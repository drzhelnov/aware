# Research Waste AWARE: a GitHub repository

**Abstract:** AWARE is a scoping review of Avoidable WAste in REsearch and a tool in development to inform academics, clinicians, patient and public partners, policy-makers, and funders on how to reduce [research waste](https://www.thelancet.com/series/research) in health and biomedical sciences. AWARE aims to identify and analyze reported cases of research waste to learn patterns of their social, economic, and career impacts. Tools exist to track [retractions](https://retractionwatch.com/) and [problematic papers](https://www.irit.fr/~Guillaume.Cabanac/problematic-paper-screener), but there are [few original investigations](https://doi.org/10.1111/jebm.12616) on methodological, underreported, and other research waste. This repository hosts AWAREâ€™s landing page: [researchwaste.info](https://researchwaste.info)
