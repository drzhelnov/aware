ðŸ“¢ **Summary:** AWARE is a scoping review of Avoidable WAste in REsearch and a tool in development to inform academics, clinicians, patient and public partners, policy-makers, and funders on how to reduce [research waste](https://www.thelancet.com/series/research) in health and biomedical sciences. AWARE aims to identify and analyze reported cases of research waste to learn patterns of their social, economic, and career impacts. Tools exist to track [retractions](https://retractionwatch.com/) and [problematic papers](https://www.irit.fr/~Guillaume.Cabanac/problematic-paper-screener), but there are [few original investigations](https://doi.org/10.1111/jebm.12616) on methodological, underreported, and other research waste.

ðŸ‘‹ **Community:** A [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kHBxe7XmJcfp8T32QxAjJqqPs_LRu4EIM4cpa_GWT7E/edit) of the research proposal is open to public comment. If you would like to do a full peer review, there is a [discussion space](https://github.com/drzhelnov/aware/discussions/1) available to GitHub users, or feel free to [contact us](#contact). Links to open peer review platforms will be made available here on [researchwaste.info](https://researchwaste.info) once the preprint is published. Thank you very much for your interest!
