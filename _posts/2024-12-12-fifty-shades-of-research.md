Doctoral Seminar, Collaborative Specialization in Global Health
CHL5701H Syllabus [fall 2024/winter 2025]

First Assignment
i) All students will be required to prepare an article for submission to Juxtaposition
(https://juxtamagazine.org/) or another publication venue of your choice (e.g.
DLSPH’s Centre for Global Health’s newsletter, the Conversation, etc.) in
consultation with the instructor. The objective of this assignment is to develop skills
for communicating research to non-academic audiences. Students are encouraged
to consider articles related to current events, talks, symposia, and their own
research. Please submit to the instructor by December 12th, 2024 at the latest for
feedback before submitting to the publication venue.

Fifty shades of research
- kolstoe & pugh
- that alzheimers case: crucified and retracted
- that chinese trials case: not crucified
- so tolerance differs across research communities
- meta thing: that chinese clin trials article missed by louise's scr because the search strategy failed to account for that; the search strategy was developed with help from mlis; is this rw or not?
- (?) maybe to throw in some words about 'the false promise of meta-research', eg the covid nma lnma case or scandal or irreproducibility of sys revs - but this may be too niche for an article for broad audience
- (?) elements of traditionalism and witch hunting to what is condemned more, historically what was easier and more socially favorable to condemn, may be more often condemned - may lack evidence to support these claims
- so this is all about research cultures
- in the context of my own phd thesis research where we want to build a tool to measure research waste, this begins to emerge as the more and more wicked to me

more thoughts after reading kolstoe & pugh thoroughly, skimming through some works that cited it, and some works referenced therein, and then after also skimming through abramo and coara

- kolstoe & pugh make a commendable attempt to set normative boundaries between integrity, ethics, and governance, although they themselves acknowledge that there also are other reshapings of these norms (eg printeger report 2016 or allea's ecoc for ri 2023 that do not seem to differentiate between ethics and integrity)
- and even despite that they mention the interconnectedness between the trinity, it is questionable id it is indeed in such a weak form like the puzzle elements that they suggest; arguably there is a lot tighter interconnections, so tight that this might actually be better conceptualized by saying that both "pure" ethics and integrity represent variants of expert assessment (with an ethics professional and research professional as assessors, respectively) whereas the governance domain remains, representing the institutionalization of these assessment
- it should also be mentioned that these two aspects would not be separate but are maybe best conceptualized as a dialectic unity and conflict, best exemplified with goodhart's law
- that streamlined approach is stronger in that it provides theoretical coverage for a case that both kolstoe & pugh and some other norm setters apparently fail to account for, namely weaker cases of research integrity which do not fall under misconduct principles and policies but are still criticized from the particular research culture standpoint, and sometimes there are even policies in place (eg reporting checklists); it is interesting that these are even not covered by allea's ecoc for ri that brings a broad lens to integrity that also includes reproducibility, for instance, but in the evaluative aspect only talks about misconduct and qrp
- it is illustrative that this discussion happens amidst a continent wide and potentially global scale conflict around coara, which ultimately comes down to quant vs qual assessment/eval of research, and importantly researcher/research institutions
- so generalizing on all that, there are apparently two axes here when talking about shades of research. one axis, let it be X axis to mimic the domain of the "research shades function", is the moral to evaluative intent, so it's whether we're just saying something is right or wrong or want to point fingers, or someplace in between. The Y axis, or this sort of codomain of this intent is the actual implementation which is a spectrum from fully pep talk starus or informal to fully institutionalized. so i argue that all kinds of axiologic judgments about research, or researchERs or research systems for that matter, that is, any attempts to add a measurement dimension to research, can be mapped someplace on that XY coordinate map.
- it's funny that all that only makes sense when we think we know what research is vs non research, eg the demarcation problem. if we also wanted to account for that we would need to add a third, Z axis here that would "measure" how research-y or unresearch-y this or that research-related thing really is (and i'm not saying only scientific/unscientific because i assume that there is also some discussion space around research being broader than science and also encompassing eg r&d within for profit companies, or mythbusters kind of entertainment, or whatever)
