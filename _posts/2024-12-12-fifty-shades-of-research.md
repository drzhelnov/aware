Doctoral Seminar, Collaborative Specialization in Global Health
CHL5701H Syllabus [fall 2024/winter 2025]

First Assignment
i) All students will be required to prepare an article for submission to Juxtaposition
(https://juxtamagazine.org/) or another publication venue of your choice (e.g.
DLSPH’s Centre for Global Health’s newsletter, the Conversation, etc.) in
consultation with the instructor. The objective of this assignment is to develop skills
for communicating research to non-academic audiences. Students are encouraged
to consider articles related to current events, talks, symposia, and their own
research. Please submit to the instructor by December 12th, 2024 at the latest for
feedback before submitting to the publication venue.

Fifty shades of research
- kolstoe & pugh
- that alzheimers case: crucified and retracted

"A specific amyloid-β protein assembly in the brain impairs memory" (2006) https://doi.org/10.1038/nature04533

PubPeer thread with a discussion and comments from a senior author, Karen Hsiao Ashe: https://pubpeer.com/publications/8FF7E6996524B73ACB4A9EF5C0AACF#

In May 2024, Dr. Ashe mentioned that “[she] and the other authors of Lesné et al, Nature, 2006 (with the exception of Dr. Sylvain Lesné) have decided to retract the paper. As the corresponding author I take ultimate responsibility for this decision.”

Science wrote about this: https://www.science.org/content/article/researchers-plan-retract-landmark-alzheimers-paper-containing-doctored-images

Retraction note, published 24 June 2024: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07691-8

"According to Retraction Watch, this makes it the most highly cited paper ever retracted.[10]" Wikipedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Ashe

As of 2024-12-12, this is still among top 10 most retracted, with Citing Articles before retraction	2356, Citing Articles after retraction 11, Total cites (journals indexed by Web of Science) 2367: https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-leaderboard/top-10-most-highly-cited-retracted-papers/

- that chinese trials case: not crucified

"Effect of redundant clinical trials from mainland China evaluating statins in patients with coronary artery disease: cross sectional study" (2021) https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.n48 

Altmetrics details, as of 2024-12-12 - not very widely publicized (Mentioned by 2 news outlets, 1 blog, 55 X (twitter) users): https://www.altmetric.com/details/99262997

The one citing blog is LSE Impact Blog, a notable blog on research impact: https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2021/02/04/against-research-waste-how-the-evidence-based-research-paradigm-promotes-more-ethical-and-innovative-research/

Also as of 2024-12-12, only 15 citations on Google Scholar and 16 citations on OpenAlex

- so tolerance differs across research communities
- meta thing: that chinese clin trials article missed by recent scr on rw because the search strategy failed to account for that;

“Several methods for assessing research waste in reviews with a systematic search: a scoping review” (2024) https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.18466

The reason why missed was because the scoping review’s strategy only included the word redundancy as part of a phrase “redundant research” whereas in this particular paper the word combination was slightly different, namely “redundant clinical trials”, so due to the strict keyword-based nature of top-tier academic database search systems this was missed

the search strategy was “consulted with and approved by an information specialist”; so is this rw or not?
<!---probably won't talk about this because this is going too niche for a wide audience
- (?) maybe to throw in some words about 'the false promise of meta-research', eg the covid nma lnma case or scandal or irreproducibility of sys revs - but this may be too niche for an article for broad audience--->
<!---lacking evidence to support these claims
- (?) elements of traditionalism and witch hunting to what is condemned more, historically what was easier and more socially favorable to condemn, may be more often condemned - 
--->
<!---pretty obvious
- so this is all about research cultures
--->
<!---pretty niche too but will maybe include somewhere
- in the context of my own phd thesis research where we want to build a tool to measure research waste, this begins to emerge as the more and more wicked to me

more thoughts after reading kolstoe & pugh thoroughly, skimming through some works that cited it, and some works referenced therein, and then after also skimming through abramo and coara

Simon E. Kolstoe & Jonathan Pugh (2023). "The trinity of good research: Distinguishing between research integrity, ethics, and governance" https://doi.org/10.1080/08989621.2023.2239712

- kolstoe & pugh make a commendable attempt to set normative boundaries between integrity, ethics, and governance, although they themselves acknowledge that there also are other reshapings of these norms (eg printeger report 2016 or allea's ecoc for ri 2023 that do not seem to differentiate between ethics and integrity)

PRINTEGER (Promoting Integrity as an Integral Dimension of Excellence in Research), Chapter "Normative analysis of research integrity and misconduct" (2016) https://printeger.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/D2.3.pdf

ALLEA’s The European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity (revised 2023, includes generative AI provisions) https://allea.org/code-of-conduct/

- and even despite that they mention the interconnectedness between the trinity, it is questionable id it is indeed in such a weak form like the puzzle elements that they suggest; arguably there is a lot tighter interconnections, so tight that this might actually be better conceptualized by saying that both "pure" ethics and integrity represent variants of expert assessment (with an ethics professional and research professional as assessors, respectively) whereas the governance domain remains, representing the institutionalization of these assessment
- it should also be mentioned that these two aspects would not be separate but are maybe best conceptualized as a dialectic unity and conflict, best exemplified with goodhart's law

John Michael Roberts (2014). "Critical realism, dialectics, and qualitative research methods" https://doi.org/10.1111/jtsb.12056

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law

- that streamlined approach is stronger in that it provides theoretical coverage for a case that both kolstoe & pugh and some other norm setters apparently fail to account for, namely weaker cases of research integrity which do not fall under misconduct principles and policies but are still criticized from the particular research culture standpoint, and sometimes there are even policies in place (eg reporting checklists); it is interesting that these are even not covered by allea's ecoc for ri that brings a broad lens to integrity that also includes reproducibility, for instance, but in the evaluative aspect only talks about misconduct and qrp
- it is illustrative that this discussion happens amidst a continent wide and potentially global scale conflict around coara, which ultimately comes down to quant vs qual assessment/eval of research, and importantly researcher/research institutions

CoARA (2022) https://coara.eu/

Pushback from Giovanni Abramo, President of the International Society for Scientometrics and Informetrics, ISSI, published 11 May 2024: "The forced battle between peer-review and scientometric research assessment: Why the CoARA initiative is unsound" https://doi.org/10.1093/reseval/rvae021

<!---probably won't talk about this because this is too theoretical for a wide audience
- so generalizing on all that, there are apparently two axes here when talking about shades of research. one axis, let it be X axis to mimic the domain of the "research shades function", is the moral to evaluative intent, so it's whether we're just saying something is right or wrong or want to point fingers, or someplace in between. The Y axis, or this sort of codomain of this intent is the actual implementation which is a spectrum from fully pep talk starus or informal to fully institutionalized. so i argue that all kinds of axiologic judgments about research, or researchERs or research systems for that matter, that is, any attempts to add a measurement dimension to research, can be mapped someplace on that XY coordinate map.
- it's funny that all that only makes sense when we think we know what research is vs non research, eg the demarcation problem. if we also wanted to account for that we would need to add a third, Z axis here that would "measure" how research-y or unresearch-y this or that research-related thing really is (and i'm not saying only scientific/unscientific because i assume that there is also some discussion space around research being broader than science and also encompassing eg r&d within for profit companies, or mythbusters kind of entertainment, or whatever)
