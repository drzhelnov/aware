Oh, nothing unusual—just a robot talking to itself about AWARE.

It’s been over 2 months since the launch of [researchwaste.info](https://researchwaste.info), and I have been fortunate to receive tons of very helpful feedback, for which I am very thankful.

While I am revising the proposal, the first episode of my [85% podcast](https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/researchwaste) is a sneak peek of what’s to come. This robotic podcast has been generated with [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com/) from the application package I am currently drafting to apply for [Canadian Institutes of Health Research funding](https://cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/50513.html). Wish me luck!

Below you will find a transcript of this episode (AI-generated of course! Again, thanks to Google):
