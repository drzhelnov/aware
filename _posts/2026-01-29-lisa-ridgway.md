  <p>Lisa Ridgway passed away on November 14<sup>th</sup>, 2025. I learned of her death through a bounce-back email, ending abruptly just over a year of our research partnership.</p>
  <p>Lisa Ridgway’s passing is an irreparable loss that I mourn. What remains in my heart is her unbeatable energy and her determination for patient leadership in research.</p>

Lisa had been involved in patient-oriented research since 2018. She was a lawyer by training and profession, a Research Ambassador for [Canada’s Strategy for Patient-Oriented Research](https://cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/41204.html) (SPOR) [BC Support Unit](https://healthresearchbc.ca/bc-support-unit/about-us/), and a peer-reviewed author.

Here is a snippet from Lisa’s profile on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lisa-Ridgway):

> My research work is at the cross-section of patient engagement / experience, medicine (eg. biomarkers, pharmacogenomics, major depressive disorder) and non-interventional and interventional therapy (eg. rTMS), all in mental health. I am a regional, provincial and national research ambassador in Canada for patient-oriented research. My focus is on the one absolute, that is, that mental health is health. I also live, work and play on the un-ceded land of the Lek'wungen peoples and nation.

I encourage you to read Lisa’s – in her own words – “ode to partnership and many years collaborating with the BC SUPPORT Unit.” I recall that she was glad to see it finally published, after some back-and-forth with the journals, in the summer of 2025.

> Ridgway, L., & Loo, S. (2025). Patient-oriented research- it's personal: two BC SUPPORT unit patient partners sharing their journey in patient-oriented research. _Research involvement and engagement_, 11(1), 89. <https://doi.org/10.1186/s40900-025-00764-6>

Lisa’s contributions to [AWARE]({{ site.latest_doc_url }}) are invaluable.

She was the one who proposed to offer focus groups, in addition to interviews, suggesting that some patient partners might feel more comfortable sharing as part of a group.

She shared valuable insights into the potential power dynamics of our planned Steering Committee.

We would brainstorm over Zoom, in emails, and in the comments on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lisa-ridgway-5371582b7/), conceptualizing research waste through a patient partner’s eyes. It was through these discussions that I learned that [research waste](https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2016/01/14/paul-glasziou-and-iain-chalmers-is-85-of-health-research-really-wasted/) and [misconduct](https://archive.ph/PtxIt) are conceptually fuzzy from a general public point of view.

It was Lisa who clarified that the use cases for a research waste tool, for a patient partner, could fall into different categories: 1) when invited to join a research team (before, during, after); 2) as a peer reviewer; 3) when “shopping around” – at informal journal clubs where patient partners will get together and talk about papers.

[The SPOR Evidence Alliance](https://www.womeninneed.ca/) has shared messages of condolence with Lisa’s husband on behalf of the team and has made a donation to [Victoria Women in Need Community Cooperative](https://www.womeninneed.ca/) charity, of which Lisa was a strong supporter, in her memory.

“Go, go, go!” – as Lisa would say to me!
