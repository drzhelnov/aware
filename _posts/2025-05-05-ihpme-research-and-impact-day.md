I am pleased to let everyone know that I am presenting the research work accomplished to date at the [IHPME Research and Impact Day 2025](https://ihpme.utoronto.ca/event/research-impact-day-2025/). This is a student-led event held annually at the Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation (Dalla Lana School of Public Health) of the University of Toronto, which is also my primary affiliation.
